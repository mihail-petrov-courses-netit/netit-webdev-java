## Introduction

Hi colleagues, within this project, you can find all the projects and exercises that have been developed and shown in the Java 2019 - 2020 course at the NetIT Learning Center.

## Organizing the material by class
The courses are held every week (except for the breaks described in the program), with two classes on Mondays and Wednesdays from 7:00 pm to 9:30 pm. The materials are divided into weeks, each of the weeks beginning with an identifier **@week** - {**week-number**} - {**course-activity-number**} where :
- {**week-number**} is the week numbers described in the syllabus
- {**course-activity-number**} is the sequence of Activity *1* for Monday and *2* for Wednesday

**For Example:** 
If you would like to see the exercises we did before the third week of Wednesday's curriculum, the identifier is **@week-3-2**. 

**Disclaimer**
If certain classes undergo a restructuring during the course, the naming convention will be preserved for consistency and the extraordinary identifier will be explicitly described in this file.

## Organizing Material by Activity
In each of the folders, you can find materials that will be easily divided into two categories.
* Exercises in class. During the active exercises, a topic will be discussed and many examples and tasks will be solved. You will find the practical solutions in the **$course-work** folder
* Self-study exercises. After the end of most of the exercises, self-study tasks will be given to improve your understanding of the concepts we have examined. You can find the homework assignments in the **$home-work** folder
* Extra materials used during the course activities. You can find them in the **$extra-work** folder

## Organization of student contribution
Everyone who wants to actively participate in the work is advised to create a GitHub profile and upload all the exercises they have developed in the form of projects. The uploaded code will be reviewed by the tutor and you will receive appropriate guidance and tips on how to successfully handle the material.
